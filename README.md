# TSP Case Study of Raipur Tourist Spots
<h2><b>Case Study Introduction:</b></h2>
<h4>We have considered 19 famous places for tourists to stop by when they visit Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India. We assumed some presumption which are listed below, to make the case study easier as this was a short duration project included in my coursework:</h4>
<ol>
<li>The tourists will reach Raipur at Raipur Airport, visit all 19 locations and then end the tour at Raipur Airport so that they can leave happily!!!!</li>
<li>We only consider minimizizing the traveling cost, we dont consider hotel or restraunt charges which might be cheaper near some places and expenisive near others</li>
<li>We consider travelling cost between point A to point B to be equal to the travelling cost between point B to point A, cost(A,B) = cost(B,A).</li>
<li>We don't consider the traveling prices to vary with time of the day, in other word we consider that at 6 AM and at 10 PM the cost between two points remains the same.</li>
</ol>
